WebP is an image format that does lossy compression of digital photographic images. WebP consists of a codec based on VP8, that Google open-sourced in May 2010 and a container based on RIFF. Webmasters, web developers and browser developers can use WebP to compress, archive and distribute digital images more efficiently.
